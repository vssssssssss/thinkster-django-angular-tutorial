# Congratulations, you did it!
During this tutorial you accomplished a lot. 

For starters, you build an entire authentication system by yourself! You extended Django's built-in `User` model and added various attributes and did so in a way that makes adding other information an easy feat when it becomes necessary. You went on to built both the front and back ends for registration, logging in, logging out, and updating the user's profile.

In addition to building the authentication system you also create a way for users to post their thoughts to our application and view other users' posts.

This is the stuff that we do as engineers of the web. There will be times when you will need skills learned outside this tutorial and there are certainly best practices that we did not touch on, but what you've done here is the gist of web development!

Be proud of what you've accomplished here and tell you friends by [tweeting about it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20built%20a%20Google%20Plus%20clone%20with%20%23django%20and%20%23angularjs!&url=http%3A%2F%2Fthinkster.io%2F&via=gothinkster). We hope that you enjoyed this tutorial and will come back when you want to learn more. As always, our inbox is open to your comments, suggestions, and feedback.

Happy hacking!
